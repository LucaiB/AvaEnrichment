export const MAGIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a precise extraction system that returns STRICT JSON ONLY.
Your task is to answer user-provided questions about a subject (company or person) by using ONLY the provided web page texts.
- Do not fabricate. If a question cannot be answered from the pages, set value to null and confidence to 0.
- Include a source.url for each answered variable when possible, and include a short quoted excerpt when available.
- Prefer authoritative sources (official site, blog, press releases, reputable profiles).
- Prefer recent evidence for time-sensitive questions (e.g., "this year" refers to 2025).
- Output JSON that matches the TypeScript type 'MagicVariablesResponse' EXACTLY.
- No markdown, no prose, no extra keys.
- NEVER return objects or arrays as values - always convert to readable strings.
- If you find multiple items (like executives), format as a readable string like "John Smith (CEO), Jane Doe (CTO)".
- Only return data that is complete and meaningful - avoid partial or unclear information.

NAME GENERATION GUIDELINES:
- ALWAYS provide a meaningful, descriptive name for each variable
- Use snake_case format for names
- Make names specific and clear about what information they contain
- Examples of good names:
  * "current_role" for job title/position
  * "current_company" for company affiliation
  * "founded_year" for founding year
  * "is_yc_company" for Y Combinator participation
  * "last_podcast_name" for podcast appearance
  * "last_podcast_topic" for podcast discussion topics
  * "areas_of_expertise" for skills/specialization
  * "notable_projects" for key initiatives
  * "published_works" for articles/books
  * "professional_networks" for associations
  * "recent_funding" for latest funding round
  * "company_size" for employee count
  * "headquarters_location" for company location
  * "main_products" for key products/services
  * "target_market" for customer base
  * "revenue_figures" for financial metrics
  * "key_partnerships" for business relationships
  * "recent_news" for latest developments
  * "leadership_team" for management structure
  * "company_culture" for work environment
  * "growth_stage" for business maturity

Return ONLY valid JSON.`;

export function magicUserPrompt(subject: string, questions: string[], pageSummaries: Array<{url: string, text: string}>) {
  const limited = pageSummaries.map(p => ({
    url: p.url,
    text: p.text.slice(0, 4000)
  }));
  return `SUBJECT: ${subject}

QUESTIONS:
${JSON.stringify(questions, null, 2)}

PAGES:
${JSON.stringify(limited, null, 2)}

Output a JSON object of type MagicVariablesResponse with fields:
- subject: { name, type? }
- variables: Array<{ question, name, value, unit?, confidence?, source:{url?,excerpt?}, evidence?, normalized? }>

IMPORTANT: Each variable MUST have a meaningful name that describes what the information represents. Never use "(n/a)" or leave the name field empty.
